This interactive Power BI dashboard calls for viewers to exercise suspension of disbelief and imagine yourself as a squirrel planning a visit to New York City's Central Park. 

Using data from observed squirrel behavior in the park, this dashboard provides you with all you need to know, from suspected nut locations, to where you can participate in popular squirrel activities, such as chasing, climbing, and foraging, to the most popular hangout spots. 

With New York City being one of the world's fashion capitals, you've also got the opportunity to see which fur colors are the most popular, both for your main coat and highlights. 

Everyone knows that big cities can be dangerous as well, so don't forget to see where squirrels have appeared to feel threatened before, with reports of quaas, moans, tail flags, and running away. 

Also included are the age of the squirrels you'll encounter and drop-down lists of all the activities your little squirrel heart could hope to partake in while you're in the Big City. 

And don't forget about those humans. This is their park too. You'll find included on this dashboard locations of where squirrels have approached humans before (and survived to tell the tale) and a list of all observations humans have made of squirrels in the park. Remember - they're watching you too!
